##Programming Exercise

####Routing of telephone calls
Some telephone operators have submitted their price lists including price per minute for different phone number prefixes. 
The price lists look like this:

Operator A:
```
1	 0.9
268	 5.1
46	 0.17
4620	 0.0
468	 0.15
4631	 0.15
4673	 0.9
46732	 1.1
```

Operator B:
```
1	 0.92
44	 0.5
46	 0.2
467	 1.0
48	 1.2
```
And so on...

The left column represents the telephone prefix (country + area code), and the right column represents 
the operators price per minute for a number starting with that prefix. 
When several prefixes match the same number, the longest one should be used. 
If you, for example, dial +46-73-212345 you will have to pay $ 1.1/min with Operator A and $ 1.0/min with Operator B. 

If a price list does not include a certain prefix you cannot use that operator to dial numbers starting with that prefix.
For example, it is not possible to dial +44 numbers with the operator A, but it is possible with Operator B.

####The Goal

The goal with this exercise is to write a program that can handle any number of price lists (operators) 
and then can calculate which operator that is cheapest for a certain number. 
You can assume that each price list can have thousands of entries, but they will all fit together in memory.

Telephone numbers should be inputted in the same format as in price lists, for example “68123456789”. 
The challenge is to find the cheapest operator for that number.

####Instructions:
1. Implement `com.test.xzha.reader.dir.DirReader.searchPrefixes` method
2. Add any number of tests - it's up to you what to test and how. (optional, but beneficial) 
3. Fix and update  project dependencies, project id broken at the moment.
5. If you feel brave enough - containerize your application (optional, but highly beneficial). 
4. Deliver working solution any way convenient for you (github link, tar/zip archive, jar, docker container, whatever).

Feel free to use any Java version you prefer, any required libraries, change/update dependencies.
